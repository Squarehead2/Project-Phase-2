Wacky Weather: Database (encrypted or unencrypted): 2023-10-14 William Black, Robert Carlson, Paul Sholter

## Status

Not approved, Database . API should work. 

## Context

Our team is creating a weather app for our project. The app's main functions are to diplay the weather , a 7 day forecast and to diplay random dad jokes to let our customers have a laugh. This ADR dtermines our decision in selecting whether or not we will use a database or not . Database securely save information that you will need to store . There are different types that can be looked at or even other options that could work as well. 

## Decision

Our choice is to use an API as it will let us get the information from a third party service but we will still be able to diplay everything that we need to. As it is just weather app we feel that there is no real reason to have a database. The main things that are needed is location , randomized jokes and a seven day forecast. This will easily be able to be done with out the extra work with the database. We feel that a database is a good option but would be better use for a different app. 

## Consequences

By selecting the API it will save us time and maintenance as this is for a project. API's are easier to implement and don't require any additional services.They are cost effective if you need to do a lot of requests. There are some drawbacks of course. These include reliance on third part services and limited customization. We would have less control over the data and customization may not be optimal for us. However we think that this is a small sacrifice for what we need to accomplish during this time.
