## Status

Touch Screen features, limited hardware requirements

## Context

Our app functionality is relatively simple in providing features being provided. We do not see a need for external hardware. Only phone devices will be needed to run the app. Although a GPS wont be used as a hardware device. Location tracking will be enabled, which requires API integration and a phone with a built in GPS. 

## Decision

We have decided to keep hardware pieces at a minimum. We do not expect a need for external hardware devices or high quality computer hardware. The app will run with minimal system requirements. The only note worthy hardware functionality is touch-screen input which will be used to navigate the app.
## Consequences

This will make programming the app more simple, as third party input and output devices will not need to be accounted for when programming. All native phone hardware will provide the functionality required for building our app.
