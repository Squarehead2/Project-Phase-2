## Status

Approved, React Native UI Framework

## Context

We are in the process of developing a weather application for Android platforms. As part of the development, we need to select a UI toolkit to ensure consistent and visually appealing user interfaces across the app. We have evaluated several options for the UI toolkit, including React Native Elements, Native Base, Shoutem UI, Ant Design Mobile, and UI Kitten.

## Decision

We have selected React Native Elements as our UI toolkit for the weather application primarily because of its user-friendly simplicity, extensive library of pre-built components that streamline development, the presence of a supportive and engaged community offering valuable assistance, customization options facilitating the creation of a unique user interface, and its commendable performance. The paramount consideration in making this choice was the toolkit's simplicity and the availability of comprehensive guides, which is particularly advantageous for our team due to our limited prior experience with React Native.

## Consequences

Choosing React Native Elements will be highly advantageous for our team due to its ability to streamline our UI design process. This streamlined process means that our developers can efficiently create and maintain user interface components, even with our team's limited experience in React Native. By utilizing React Native Elements, we can ensure that our app maintains a consistent design throughout all its pages. This consistency not only enhances the overall user experience but also contributes to the app's professional and polished appearance. Users will appreciate the coherence and familiarity in the design, which can lead to higher user satisfaction and ease of navigation across different sections of the application. Ultimately, React Native Elements will play a key role in achieving our goal of delivering a user-friendly and visually appealing weather app with a seamless and cohesive design.
